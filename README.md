    <a href="https://tyrish.itch.io/zd1r">Zelda Dungeon #1 Remake</a>
    <p>
      Created by Ty Kennedy, used Unity and C# to remake Zelda Dungeon #1 with a partner in EECS 494 Fall 2025. 
      I worked on implementing the custom mechanic feature and level, almost all sprite animations, a decent amount 
      of enemy AI, transitions, usage of prefabs, audio effects, and weapon systems such as the sword.
